Let's play with data mining and machine learning concepts!

This repository contains some scripts that I created to help myself in understanding how data mining and machine learning works. And since human memory is kind of unreliable, my future self might thank the now me for documenting what I have learned.
If others get benefit from it, that is a plus.

Feel free to point out mistake/errors if you happen to spot one!

The scripts would be largely in Python or Matlab.
